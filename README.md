# GWBasicConverter
Convert GWBASIC encoded source code into human readable source code

There are some old code written in GWBasic.
The code saved in BAS file was encoded and not human readable.

This project is a port of the python project GWBasicDecoder, which provide
the same function as the python one.

However this code is in C# which you can easily translate into C++ or Java.

Enjoy,
