# GWBasicConverter
Convert GWBASIC encoded source code into human readable source code

There are some old code written in GWBasic.
The code saved in BAS file was encoded and not human readable.

This project is a port of the python project GWBasicDecoder, which provide
the same function as the python one: decode the BAS file and produce the 
human readable format (you can specify the encoding).

3 samples are provided as the python project did.

Some number format may be not quite correct, so you may have to fix it accordingly.

However this code is in C# which you can easily translate into C++ or Java.

Enjoy,

Yilin
